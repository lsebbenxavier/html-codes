• Document definition (doctype)
• Head
• Body

# add-css
Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding style to a web document.

The CSS code can be applied directly to the tags or be contained within the <style> tags.

It is also possible, instead of placing the formatting inside the document, to create a link to a CSS file containing the styles.d
