Hyper Text Markup Language - HTML serves to give meaning and organize information on websites.

It is possible to understand the HTML document in a very simple way, by dividing blocks of essential tags, according to the following structure:

• Document definition (doctype)
• Head
• Body

1. The purpose of this repository is to bring together several models of html code.

Facilitating future projects with compact and functional structures.

# add-css
Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding style to a web document.

The CSS code can be applied directly to the tags or be contained within the <style> tags.

It is also possible, instead of placing the formatting inside the document, to create a link to a CSS file containing the styles.

The matching rules for CSS are called selectors, a style definition can be matched with a selector or a comma-separated group of selectors, a selector can match an element by:

- Element of type: element_name {style definition; }
- Type element with class: element_name.class_name {style definition; }
- All elements with the class: .class_name {style definition;}
- The element with the id: #id_of_element {style definition; }
- Group wedding: element_name_01, element_name_02, .class_name {style definition; }
